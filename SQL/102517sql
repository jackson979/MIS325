--using inner join to get data from 2 tables
SELECT invoice_number, vendor_name
FROM vendors INNER JOIN invoices    
    ON vendors.vendor_id = invoices.vendor_id
ORDER BY invoice_number;

--using table aliases for all tables in joins (v and i)
SELECT invoice_number, vendor_name, invoice_due_date,
    (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total)
        AS balance_due
FROM vendors v JOIN invoices i
    ON v.vendor_id = i.vendor_id
WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total) > 0
ORDER BY invoice_due_date DESC;

--using table aliases for one table in a join (line_items)
SELECT invoice_number, line_item_amt, line_item_description
FROM invoices JOIN invoice_line_items line_items
    ON invoices.invoice_id = line_items.invoice_id
WHERE account_number = 540
ORDER BY invoice_date;

--using AND/OR operator to have multiple join conditions
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_date, invoice_total, line_item_amt
FROM invoices i JOIN invoice_line_items li
    ON (i.invoice_id = li.invoice_id) AND
        (i.invoice_total > li.line_item_amt)
ORDER BY invoice_number;

--using WHERE clause to narrow join results
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_date, invoice_total, line_item_amt
FROM invoices i JOIN invoice_line_items li    
    ON i.invoice_id = li.invoice_id
WHERE i.invoice_total > li.line_item_amt
ORDER BY invoice_number;

--joining multiple tables
SELECT vendor_name, invoice_number, invoice_date, line_item_amt, account_description
FROM vendors v    
    JOIN invoices i ON v.vendor_id = i.vendor_id
    JOIN invoice_line_items li ON i.invoice_id = li.invoice_id
    JOIN general_ledger_accounts gl ON li.account_number = gl.account_number
WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total) > 0
ORDER BY vendor_name, line_item_amt DESC;

---EXERCISE 1
SELECT * FROM invoices i JOIN vendors v
    ON v.vendor_id = i.vendor_id
ORDER BY invoice_id;

--EXERCISE 2
SELECT vendor_name, invoice_number, invoice_date, (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total) AS balance_due
FROM vendors v JOIN invoices i ON v.vendor_id = i.vendor_id
WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total) <> 0
ORDER BY vendor_name;
